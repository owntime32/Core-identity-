Memory-efficiency rails to keep the whole system upright

You’re thinking like a systems architect who’s seen real fires. Let’s put rails on every edge: central core, minis, storage, and the pipes between them. The goal: graceful degradation, zero data loss, no “humpstack” blowups, and automatic recovery.

---

Why memory rails matter here

- Central core fuses, indexes, and routes—any spike here ripples everywhere.
- Minis run parallel learning loops—bursts and drift can create runaway growth.
- Compressed batches and fusion must be streamable—no full-buffer expands.
- Governance should translate pressure into policy: slow the firehose, compact more, and shed load intelligently.

---

Central core guardrails

- Hard ceilings
  - Max resident memory watermark (e.g., 75–85% of container limit).
  - Max concurrent fusions and batch ingests.
- Adaptive policy dials
  - Raise compression level, shrink cachemb, increase sampling, lower batchmax_count under pressure.
- Spill-first design
  - Prefer spill-to-disk for large joins/fusions; keep hot indexes in memory only.
- Isolation
  - Run fusion and heavy analytics in separate worker processes; restartable without taking the core down.

---

Mini-core guardrails

- Credit-based backpressure
  - “Read” and “write” credits refresh each interval; spend credits per byte and per insight.
- Size-aware learning
  - Cap motif/concept library; promote only on novelty/utility thresholds.
- Bounded queues
  - Fixed-depth work queues; when full, switch to summary/delta mode.
- Personalization shard limits
  - Per-user caps with decay: old, low-utility state is compacted or archived.

---

Backpressure and load shedding

- Token buckets on:
  - Ingestion (R.D interpretations), fusion tasks, outbound insights.
- Priority tiers
  - Keep safety/compliance signals always admitted; defer low-priority enrichment.
- Brownouts
  - Temporarily disable expensive features (e.g., deep similarity) when RSS crosses a high watermark.
- Admission control
  - Probabilistic drop/sampling of low-utility inputs under extreme pressure.

---

Storage, cache, and compression

- Stream, don’t slurp
  - Zstd/LZ4 streaming; slice-by-offset reads; never fully decompress a batch in memory.
- Content-addressed dedup
  - Single canonical payload per unique content; references everywhere else.
- Cache policy
  - Byte-capped LRU with TinyLFU admission to avoid cache pollution.
- Tiering
  - Hot (RAM), warm (compressed files), cold (coalesced summaries); automatic demotion by recency and utility.

---

Observability and crash prevention

- Metrics to watch
  - RSS %, cache hit/miss, heap alloc rate, GC time, batch decompression time, queue depths, spill bytes, credit burn rate.
- Health checks
  - Liveness (event loop advancing), readiness (queue < threshold), memory headroom (> X%).
- Watchdogs
  - Kill/restart workers exceeding memory or time budgets; idempotent tasks with sequence numbers.
- Telemetry hygiene
  - Rate-limit logs/traces; drop verbose logs first under pressure.

---

Resilience patterns that matter

- Idempotent writes and WAL
  - Every state change replayable; avoid partial commits.
- Checkpointing
  - Periodic snapshots of policy, credits, and library registries.
- Circuit breakers
  - Trip on repeated timeouts between core and minis; exponential backoff with jitter.
- Canary + rolling restarts
  - Deploy features to a slice; roll forward only if KPIs stay green.

---

Python-level practices that save RAM

- Use memoryviews and arrays for binary ops; avoid copying buffers.
- Prefer iterators/generators; process in chunks.
- Separate processes for heavy tasks; reclaim memory via OS on restart.
- tracemalloc sampling and leak sentinels on hot paths.
- Columnar on-disk formats for large tabular interim data; mmap when feasible.

---

Integration plan (phased)

1. Instrumentation
   - Add memory metrics, queue depths, and credit counters to core and minis.
2. Policy hooks
   - Wire governance dials: cachemb, batchmax_count, compression level, sampling rates.
3. Backpressure
   - Token buckets on ingress/egress; bounded queues with brownout switches.
4. Spill + streaming
   - Replace full-decompress with streaming slice reads; add spill-to-disk in fusion.
5. Isolation
   - Move fusion and heavy clustering to worker processes with watchdogs.
6. Game day
   - Chaos/load tests; verify brownouts, shedding, and recovery without data loss.

Code snippets you can drop in

Memory watchdog (central core)

`python
import psutil, time, threading

class MemWatchdog:
    def init(self, high=0.80, critical=0.90, onhigh=None, oncrit=None):
        self.high, self.crit = high, critical
        self.onhigh, self.oncrit = onhigh, oncrit
        self._stop = False

    def start(self, interval=2.0):
        t = threading.Thread(target=self._run, args=(interval,), daemon=True)
        t.start()

    def _run(self, interval):
        p = psutil.Process()
        while not self._stop:
            rss = p.memory_info().rss
            pct = rss / psutil.virtual_memory().total
            if pct >= self.crit and self.oncrit: self.oncrit(rss, pct)
            elif pct >= self.high and self.onhigh: self.onhigh(rss, pct)
            time.sleep(interval)
`

Wire onhigh to: shrink cache, raise compression, enable sampling. Wire oncrit to: pause ingestion, flush queues to disk, kill/restart heavy workers.

Token-bucket backpressure

`python
import time

class TokenBucket:
    def init(self, ratepers, burst):
        self.rate = ratepers; self.capacity = burst
        self.tokens = burst; self.last = time.time()

    def allow(self, cost=1):
        now = time.time()
        self.tokens = min(self.capacity, self.tokens + (now - self.last)*self.rate)
        self.last = now
        if self.tokens >= cost:
            self.tokens -= cost
            return True
        return False
`

Use one per mini for reads/writes; cost proportional to bytes.

Spill-to-disk buffer

`python
import tempfile, os

class SpillBuffer:
    def init(self, maxmembytes=3210241024):
        self.max = maxmembytes
        self.buf = bytearray()
        self.tmp = None

    def append(self, chunk: bytes):
        if self.tmp:
            self.tmp.write(chunk)
        elif len(self.buf) + len(chunk) <= self.max:
            self.buf.extend(chunk)
        else:
            self.tmp = tempfile.TemporaryFile()
            self.tmp.write(self.buf)
            self.buf = bytearray()
            self.tmp.write(chunk)

    def read(self):
        if self.tmp:
            self.tmp.seek(0)
            while True:
                data = self.tmp.read(65536)
                if not data: break
                yield data
            self.tmp.close()
        else:
            yield bytes(self.buf)
        self.buf = bytearray(); self.tmp = None
`

Streaming slice read (no full decompress)

`python
def readbatchslice(reader, path, offset, length):
    # Reader should return a file-like iterator over decompressed bytes
    it = reader.stream(path)
    consumed = 0
    for chunk in it:
        if consumed + len(chunk) <= offset:
            consumed += len(chunk); continue
        start = max(0, offset - consumed)
        end = min(len(chunk), start + (length - 0))
        yield chunk[start:end]
        consumed += len(chunk)
        length -= (end - start)
        if length <= 0: break
