this system is a open node connection that enables dynamic logistics and upholds secure data transfer to and from API to API. it at its core is a linear file manager that updated code given down from the core passes in a message to all systems pathways with specific tile in code extraction to complete a task or event. with parental control down the branch It also works as a processing system lauchpad enabling enhanced system updates that gain more advanced to be uploaded without overload
