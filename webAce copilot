this program is a core extension a.i program that threw core and cloud updates and connection runs threw internet searches with multiple crawling agent programs as it's support feeds on relevant question pathways as a tiled answers get logged. all logged answers are sent to core an cloud as tagged log tiled answers for mature integration into enhanced processes for advanced search
